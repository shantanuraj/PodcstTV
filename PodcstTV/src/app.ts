 * @description The onLaunch callback is invoked after the application JavaScript

 * that contains options passed in for launch. These options are defined in the
 * swift or objective-c client code. Options can be used to communicate to
 * your JavaScript code that data and as well as state information, like if the
 * the app is being launched in the background.
 *
 * The location attribute is automatically added to the object and represents
 * the URL that was used to retrieve the application JavaScript.
